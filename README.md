##### JUSTIN BIEBER DENIES RUMOURS HE IS TRAINING TO BECOME A MINISTER

Justin Bieber has swiftly responded to rumours and fake news that he is training to become a minister at the Hillsong Church. He was forced to deny articles that claimed an anonymous source alleged that he "wants to be a full-fledged minister next year.”

Furious the rumours had been published by press without any reliable source, the singer labelled it "fake news" on social media. The hitmaker wrote on Instagram: "I'm not studying to be a minister or anything even close to that. Have no desire for that this is fake news."

Bieber also went on to clarify his place of worship, adding: "And btw Hillsong is not my church... For clarity I am part of Churchome.” "Church is not a place. We are the church. We don't need a building to connect with god. God is with us wherever we are” he continued.

His wedding to Hailey Baldwin was officiated by Judah Smith from Churchome, so it obviously holds a special place in his heart. However, the Anyone hitmaker has previously thanked Hillsong for pulling him out of his most "dark" times during his rise to fame.

### WEIRD NEWS  (web search)

##### NEW STUDY FINDS STAR SIGNS MOST LIKELY TO WIN THE LOTTERY

A new study has concluded that Pisces were the luckiest people last year with more lottery wins than any other star sign on the charts.
Data crunched by experts shows which star sign took home the most division one prizes in 2020, and it’s not looking great for Sagittarius.
Those born between February 19 and March 20 won 11.6 per cent of top lottery prizes during the study period analyzed.
Not far behind Pisces were Gemini players who scored 9.9 per cent of division one wins, with Virgo following closely with 8.9 per cent.
Just after that was the Aquarius star sign, with 8.5 per cent.
Only 6 per cent of division one winners were Sagittarians, making them the unluckiest star sign if you want to win big.
Lott spokesperson Lauren Cooney said it would be interesting to see if these winning trends continued for the different star signs.
“Pisces are typically considered to be generous and empathetic in nature, with a deep sense of kindness and compassion” she explained.
“It would be interesting to know if these traits transcended with their lottery windfalls and they shared their prizes with their loved ones.”
